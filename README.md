# 8-Point Spacing template.

Great design is obvious when it's simple, clear, and consistent. One of the key element what makes it consistent is a grid system. Arguably, the most efficient grid system currently used in the product design is 8-Point Spacing method, also known as 8-Point Grid.

## What it is.

The 8-Point method is a very simple concept. The idea behind it is to measure the property values of all the elements of a screen or a page layout in increments of eight (in some cases of four). For instance 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 points and so on.

According to Material Design tutorial, there are different alternative techniques, used in 8-Point method:

**Keylines.** The distance between layout elements and the left edge of the screen, measured horizontally (by width), whereas the height stays the same (as the height of the screen).

**Padding.** The space between UI elements, measured horizontally (by width) or vertically (by height).

**Vertical Spacing.** The height of the layout elements, measured vertically, whereas the width stays the same (as the width of the screen).

## Why to use it.

Using grid systems in product design delivers better user experience by
* Providing the hierarchy of the elements;
* Eliminating the visual complexity; 
* Simplifying the decision–making process;
* Bringing a consistency across different screen sizes;

Among other benefits of using 8-Point method is its ability to boost the productivity. This system makes it very simple to measure and create the elements of the layout  in increments of eight.

## 8-Point Spacing Template.

To expedite my personal layout design process and increase productivity, I designed a Sketch symbols library with prebuilt elements measured in increments of eight, based on the screen size of the iPhone X (375x812px). 

The library consists of all the types of elements to be used with methods, mentioned in the Material Design article, such as Keylines, Padding, and Vertical spacing. For the sake of convenience, I also added Margins elements which are the space between the left and the right edges of the screen and the very first of their element on either side.
